# UAV-for-human-detection-and-geolocalisation

Recent advances in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) make flying robots
suitable platforms for carrying sensors and computer systems capable of performing advanced tasks.
We presents a technique which allows detecting humans at a high frame rate
on standard hardware onboard an autonomous UAV in a real-world outdoor environment
using tensorflow. Detected human positions are geolocated and a map of points of interest
is built. Such a saliency map can, for example, be used to plan medical supply delivery
during a disaster relief effort. The technique has been implemented using DroNet: a convolutional neural network that can safely drive a drone through the streets of a city. We
propose to train a UAV from data collected by cars and bicycles. It allows a UAV to successfully fly at relative high altitudes and even in indoor environments, such as parking lots and corridors.
